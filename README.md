# Malaria-Detection-using-Cell-Images-Deep-Learning-in-Healthcare-
The objective of this project is to propose and develop a computer-aided diagnostic system for malaria detection using cell images. By analysing digital images of blood cells obtained through microscopy, these systems aim to identify malaria-infected cells and distinguish them from uninfected cells.
